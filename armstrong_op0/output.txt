Dear John Doe,

After a thorough analysis of your financial data, we have come up with the following recommendations for you:

1. Recommended Action: We recommend that you use your monthly surplus of ₹43,000 to cover your EMI payments. However, this amount is insufficient to cover your total EMI of ₹55,000. Therefore, we recommend withdrawing an additional ₹12,000 from your available assets to meet this shortfall.

2. Reason for the Recommended Action: Your monthly income is ₹200,000, out of which you are currently saving ₹43,000. However, your total EMI payments amount to ₹55,000, which is more than your savings. This means that you are facing a shortfall of ₹12,000 every month. To cover this shortfall, we recommend using a part of your assets. You have total assets worth ₹20,250,000, so withdrawing ₹12,000 monthly will not significantly impact your overall financial health.

Please note that these recommendations are based on your current financial situation and goals. It is important to regularly review and update your financial plan to ensure it continues to meet your needs and goals.

We hope this analysis helps you in making informed decisions about your finances. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further clarification.

Best Regards,
Client Investments Analyzer

Dear Client,

Based on the data provided, here's a comprehensive analysis of your financial situation:

1. **Net Worth**: Your net worth, which is the difference between your total assets and liabilities, stands at ₹15,250,000. 

2. **Asset Allocation**: Your assets are divided into three buckets - liquid, retirement, and fixed. The majority of your assets (approximately 71.60%) are in fixed assets, primarily real estate. Liquid assets make up about 18.52% of your portfolio, and retirement assets account for the remaining 9.88%.

3. **Equity Exposure**: You have exposure to equity markets, which is a good strategy for long-term wealth creation, given the higher returns equity investments can potentially offer.

4. **Liabilities**: Your total liabilities amount to ₹5,000,000. The highest rate loan is a personal loan from Bajaj Finance with an outstanding amount of ₹200,000 at an annual interest rate of 12%.

5. **Monthly Surplus**: Your monthly surplus, which is the difference between your monthly cash inflow and expenses (excluding EMIs), is ₹43,000. 

6. **Savings Gap**: Your required monthly savings is ₹762,231.35, which is significantly higher than your current monthly surplus. This has resulted in a savings gap of ₹719,231.35.

7. **Financial Goals**: You have several financial goals, including retirement, education for Alice and Bob, vacations, starting a business, and buying a farmhouse. The required monthly savings for these goals range from ₹5,876.40 (for a vacation in Japan) to ₹346,285.19 (for retirement).

8. **Flags**: There are several flags in your financial situation that need attention. These include overweight in low yield assets, low savings, high spending, and a high savings gap.

Given your current financial situation, it's crucial to address the savings gap. You may need to either increase your income, reduce your expenses, or adjust your financial goals. Additionally, considering the overweight in low yield assets, it might be beneficial to reassess your investment strategy to achieve a more balanced portfolio.

Please note that this analysis is based on the current data and may need to be adjusted as your financial situation changes. Regular reviews of your financial plan are recommended.

TASK 4 OUTPUT
loan_liquidation_plan_task : 

Dear Client,

Let's dive into your financial situation and the proposed liquidation plan. 

You currently have three loans: a home loan from HDFC Bank with an outstanding amount of ₹4,000,000, a car loan from ICICI Bank with an outstanding amount of ₹800,000, and a personal loan from Bajaj Finance with an outstanding amount of ₹200,000. 

To manage these loans, we've devised a liquidation plan that uses your assets strategically. 

1. **Cash**: We propose using ₹300,000 of your cash reserves to fund the EMIs for all three loans for the first 25 months. 

2. **Fixed Deposit**: Next, we suggest liquidating ₹250,000 from your fixed deposit to continue funding the EMIs from the 26th to the 45th month.

3. **Mutual Fund**: Finally, we recommend using ₹193,000 from your mutual fund investments to fund the EMIs from the 46th to the 61st month.

This plan ensures that your personal loan will be paid off by May 2029, your car loan by October 2030, and your home loan by November 2041.

In addition to this, we suggest using your monthly surplus of ₹43,000 to meet the EMI shortfall. For the first 52 months, your total EMI is ₹55,000, so the surplus covers most of it. From the 53rd to the 69th month, your total EMI reduces to ₹50,000, and from the 70th month onwards, it further reduces to ₹35,000, which is fully covered by your monthly surplus.

Any surplus left unused can be reinvested for growth. For instance, we have identified a surplus of ₹507,000 that can be invested in a mutual fund.

In total, we are suggesting a liquidation of ₹743,000 across three assets to meet the EMI shortfall. Once the shortest-term loans are paid, your monthly surplus covers the rest. 

Remember, this plan is designed to help you manage your loans effectively without significantly impacting your lifestyle or long-term financial goals. It's important to review this plan periodically and make adjustments as needed.

I hope this provides a clear understanding of your liquidation plan. If you have any questions or need further clarification, please feel free to ask.

TASK 5 OUTPUT
client_financial_planner_task :

Dear Client,

After a comprehensive analysis of your financial data, we have prepared a detailed report of your financial situation and future cashflows. 

## Asset Allocation

Your assets are divided into several categories:

1. **Cash**: ₹507,000. This is a liquid asset and can be used to meet immediate expenses or emergencies.
2. **Fixed Deposit**: Currently, you do not have any amount in fixed deposits.
3. **Mutual Fund**: Currently, you do not have any investments in mutual funds.
4. **Direct Equity**: ₹2,000,000. This is a high-risk, high-return investment and is suitable for long-term wealth creation.
5. **Provident Fund**: ₹1,200,000. This is a low-risk investment and is suitable for retirement planning.
6. **Public Provident Fund**: ₹800,000. This is a government-backed, low-risk investment and is suitable for long-term savings.
7. **LIC Policy**: ₹500,000. This is a low-risk investment and provides insurance coverage.
8. **Real Estate**: ₹14,500,000. This includes your primary residence and a rental apartment.

## Future Cashflows

Your future cashflows are based on your monthly surplus utilization and the availability of surplus funds. 

1. For the first 52 months, your total EMI is ₹55,000 and the surplus used is ₹43,000. There is no surplus unused.
2. From the 53rd to the 69th month, your total EMI reduces to ₹50,000 and the surplus used remains ₹43,000. There is no surplus unused.
3. From the 70th month onwards, your total EMI further reduces to ₹35,000 and the surplus used is equal to the EMI. The surplus unused is ₹8,000.

The surplus available from the 70th month onwards is ₹8,000.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following:

1. Continue with the current asset allocation strategy as it is well-diversified and aligned with your financial goals.
2. Use the monthly surplus of ₹43,000 to cover your EMI payments. For the shortfall, withdraw from your available assets.
3. From the 70th month onwards, invest the surplus unused of ₹8,000 in a suitable investment option for additional wealth creation.

Please note that these recommendations are based on the current financial situation and may need to be adjusted as your financial situation changes. Regular reviews of your financial plan are recommended.
