#     Given the information about the client's monthly_surplus and assets info {asset}, you must arrange the 
#     assets in a order such that the top assets are the ones which are highly liquidiable and the 
#     bottom one are highly illiquidable.
    
#     1. You must analyze each asset closely, if the asset is convertible then it means that it is convertible, but
#     also you must see that which type of asset it is, say if a asset is convertible and the type of asset is provident_fund then that asset is convertible in liquid only when the client
#     resigns from his job, also we see that direct equity type of assets are easily convertible but again there is a condition that if the client is in profit then only the client will liquidate his equity, now also there is
#     a gold asset in the asset list then in that case we know that gold is easily liquidable as it's volatility is not that high as compared to equity, so even if the client has loss in gold investment it may not be that hight as compared to 
#     the equity assets. Also we see see that fixed deposit investments in bank are easily liquidable. Like this there are many scenarios which you will have to consider and then decide which investments are liquidable easily practically and then 
#     place them from top to bottom order. 
#     2. The output that you will provide must have the same features as that the input has.
#     3. Do again that all the assets are there in the output provided along with all the features of it.
#     4. PROVIDE ONLY THE SORTED ASSETS IN JSON FORMAT AND NO EXPLAINATION OR NOTE OR ANYTHING

#     You are expectionally great Financial Liquidity Sorter, you analyze each investments of client and give them the correct order of their assets which are liquidable easily.
