[95m## Task:[00m [92m**Your Central Objective:** As the Chief Financial Planning Orchestrator, your mission is to oversee and manage the step-by-step creation of a comprehensive financial plan for the client. You will achieve this by strictly adhering to the detailed "General Logic Framework – Armstrong Capital" (provided below) and utilizing the initial client data (which will be provided to you as context from the DataExtractorAgent's completed task). You will delegate specific analytical tasks to specialist agents, and ensure the logical flow and consistency of the entire process.
**KEY RESOURCE 1: Initial Client Data (JSON String format)** This data will be supplied to you as the output from the preceding DataExtractorAgent's task. It is your starting point and will be progressively augmented by the specialist agents you delegate to. You must identify and use this client data string from the information provided to you.
**KEY RESOURCE 2: General Logic Framework – Armstrong Capital (Your Primary Instruction Manual):** ''' GENERAL LOGIC FRAMEWORK – ARMSTRONG CAPITAL 
1. Client Personal Details 
Personal Information Capture 
Input Fields: 
• 
Client Name 
• 
Date of Birth (DOB) 
• 
Desired Retirement Age (default to 55 if not provided) 
• 
Spouse Name 
• 
Number of Children 
 
  Investment Horizon Classification 
Logic: 
• 
Calculate years until retirement: 
Retirement Age - Current Age 
• 
For children's education goals (if age is provided), calculate: 
Expected Education Age - Current Age of Child 
Classification Rules: 
• 
If time to goal is > 5 years → Long-Term 
• 
If time to goal is 3–5 years → Medium-Term 
• 
If time to goal is < 3 years → Short-Term 
 Risk Appetite Assessment 
Step 1: Equity Exposure Check 
• 
If current assets include Direct Equity, Equity MFs, or other equity instruments → Equity 
Exposure = Yes 
• 
Else → Equity Exposure = No 
Step 2: Time to Retirement 
• 
If Years to Retirement < 5: 
o If Equity Exposure = Yes → Risk Appetite = Medium 
o If Equity Exposure = No → Risk Appetite = Low 
• 
If Years to Retirement ≥ 5: 
o If Equity Exposure = Yes → Risk Appetite = Medium to High 
o If Equity Exposure = No → Risk Appetite = Medium 
 
 
Goal Identification 
Logic: 
• 
If user has specified goals → Use user-defined goals 
• 
Else → Automatically assign: 
o Retirement Planning (based on retirement age or default age 55) 
o Children's Education (if children present and age-appropriate) 
 
2. Current Assets & Liabilities 
1. Current Assets Summary (Visualization) 
Objective: Display each current asset's proportion in a pie chart and show total asset value below. 
Inputs (Sample Categories): 
• 
Bank Balance / Cash 
• 
Fixed Deposits 
• 
Mutual Funds (Equity / Debt) 
• 
Direct Equity 
• 
Bonds 
• 
Real Estate 
• 
Provident Fund (PF) 
• 
Public Provident Fund (PPF) 
• 
National Pension Scheme (NPS) 
• 
Gold 
• 
Other investments 
Logic: 
• 
Calculate total asset value: 
Total = Sum of all individual assets 
• 
For each asset: 
o 
% = (Asset Value / Total) × 100 
• 
Plot pie chart with: 
o 
Asset categories as segments 
o 
Percentage labels 
Below Pie Chart Display: 
• 
Total Assets: ₹<Total Value> (formatted in lakhs or crores) 
• 
If liability is present Subtract it and show the net worth post that.  
 
 
 
 
 
3. Current Asset Classification Sheet 
Objective: Classify assets into three buckets: 
A. Liquid Assets (Accessible financial assets) 
Includes: 
• 
Bank Balance / Cash 
• 
Fixed Deposits 
• 
Mutual Funds (Equity/Debt) 
• 
Direct Equity 
• 
Bonds 
• 
Gold 
• 
Other Market-linked Assets 
B. Retirement Assets 
Includes: 
• 
Provident Fund (PF) 
• 
Public Provident Fund (PPF) 
• 
National Pension Scheme (NPS) 
C. Fixed Assets 
Includes: 
• 
Real Estate 
• 
Land 
• 
Property 
Logic: 
• 
Read asset types and classify into the respective bucket 
• 
Sum values under each category 
• 
Display output as a table or stacked bar chart with: 
o 
Category Name 
o 
Total Value 
o 
% of Total Assets 
4. Loan Pre-payment analysis – (If its present) 
Step 1: Evaluate All Existing Loans 
Before focusing on the home loan, review the client’s full debt profile: 
• 
List all active loans: Home loan, car loan, personal loan, credit card debt, etc. 
• 
Compare interest rates: 
o Personal loans and credit cards often carry the highest interest rates. 
o Car loans generally come with moderate interest rates and no tax benefits. 
o Home loans usually have the lowest rates, with added tax deductions. 
 
Debt Repayment Strategy: 
1. Close highest-interest loans first, unless early closure incurs heavy penalties. 
2. If liquidity is tight, consider refinancing high-cost loans. 
3. Use debt snowball (lowest balance first) or avalanche (highest interest first) based on 
behavioural or financial preferences. 
Example: If the client holds a personal loan at 14% and a home loan at 8%, personal loan closure should 
take priority unless the liquidity is specifically earmarked for home loan prepayment. 
 
Step 2: Check for Liquidity Constraints 
• 
If EMI burden > 50% of net monthly inflows, avoid increasing EMI or committing to large lump-
sum prepayments. 
• 
Ensure surplus availability for: 
o Essential living expenses 
o Emergency fund 
o High-priority goals (retirement, children’s education) 
Consider a SIP toward prepayment or staggered partial payments only after funding priority goals. 
 
Step 3: Evaluate Existing Liquid Assets 
• 
If the client holds low-yielding instruments (e.g., FDs, liquid funds, idle savings): 
o Use part of these assets to prepay the costliest loan (based on Step 1). 
o Reinvest EMI savings into higher-return investments. 
 
Step 4: Prioritize Home Loan Prepayment (if applicable) 
Assess Based on EMI Composition 
• 
In early years, the interest portion is higher, making prepayment more effective. 
• 
In later years, when the principal dominates, the benefit is limited. 
Assess Based on Tax Benefits 
Section Deduction Type Max Limit 
Notes 
24(b) 
Interest Paid 
₹2,00,000 Only for self-occupied homes 
80C 
Principal Repaid ₹1,50,000 Shared with other 80C items 
Avoid over-prepaying if it leads to underutilization of deductions under 80C and 24(b). 
 
Step 5: Prepayment Strategy Options 
• 
Lump Sum Prepayment: From bonuses, maturing policies, or FDs. 
• 
SIP Toward Prepayment: Invest surplus monthly in equity/hybrid funds to build a corpus for future 
prepayment. 
• 
EMI Top-up: Only if EMI is ≤ 30% of net income and goals are well-funded. 
 
Final Decision Framework 
Ask these key questions: 
• 
Is a liquidity cushion in place? 
• 
Are high-cost loans already closed or being addressed? 
• 
Are financial goals fully funded or at risk? 
• 
What is the effective return on investments vs. interest saved by prepaying? 
• 
Will prepayment reduce tax benefits significantly? 
• 
 Can a hybrid strategy (partial prepay + invest) optimize both risk and return? 
Recommendation: Run a scenario analysis comparing: 
• 
Full prepayment 
• 
Full investment 
• 
Partial prepayment + continued investing 
to determine the optimal financial outcome. 
5. Goal Input Sources 
Goal Types: 
• 
Retirement: Based on client input or assume retirement at age 55 
• 
Education: 
o 
Undergraduate (UG) → Default at Child’s Age 18 
o 
Postgraduate (PG) → Default at Child’s Age 22 
• 
Other Goals: As explicitly specified by the client (e.g., Home Purchase, Car, Vacation, Marriage, etc.) 
 2. Goal Details Captured per Entry 
Each goal entry should include: 
• 
Goal Name (e.g., Retirement, UG for Child 1, PG for Child 2, Home Purchase) 
• 
Target Year (calculated) 
• 
Time Remaining (Years) = Target Year – Current Year 
• 
Estimated Cost (optional) – If input is available 
3. Goal Target Year Calculation 
Retirement Goal: 
Target Year = Current Year + (Retirement Age – Current Age) 
Education Goals: 
For each child: 
• 
UG Goal Year = Current Year + (18 – Child’s Age) 
• 
PG Goal Year = Current Year + (22 – Child’s Age) 
Other Goals: 
• 
Use client’s provided year or calculate using time to goal. 
4. Goal Sorting Logic 
• 
Sort all goals by Target Year (ascending order) 
• 
In case of same year, maintain order: Education → Retirement → Others 
6.Current Financial Health 
To assess the client’s current financial health across the following dimensions: 
• 
Liquidity 
• 
Flexibility 
• 
Asset Allocation (vs. ideal benchmarks) 
• 
Goal Feasibility (based on Retirement & Education needs) 
• 
Savings Adequacy 
• 
Spending Behaviour 
Even though this sheet comes earlier in the plan, it must reference calculations from later sheets, especially 
retirement and education goal feasibility. 
 
 2. Key Parameters and Logic 
A. Liquidity Ratio 
• 
Formula: 
Liquid Assets / Total Assets 
• 
Red Flag if: 
< 10–15% → Suggests illiquidity 
B. Real Estate + Low Yield Exposure 
• 
Combine: 
o 
Real Estate 
o 
LIC Policies 
o 
FDs 
• 
Formula: 
(Low Yield Assets / Total Assets) × 100 
• 
Red Flag if: 
> 50% → Overweight in illiquid/low-return assets 
C. Flexibility 
• 
If majority of assets are in fixed income + real estate → Low flexibility 
• 
If substantial assets in market-linked or redeemable products → Medium to High flexibility 
Classification: 
• 
High: >30% in market-linked/liquid 
• 
Medium: 15–30% 
• 
Low: <15% 
D. Goal Feasibility Reference (from Retirement/Education Sheets) 
• 
Use gap between goal corpus required and corpus available + projected savings 
Logic: 
• 
Feasibility Rating: 
o 
Feasible: Gap ≤ 10% 
o 
Stretch: Gap between 10–30% 
o 
Unrealistic: Gap > 30% 
E. Savings Gap Analysis 
• 
If current savings rate is inadequate to meet retirement/education goals: 
o 
Show required increase: 
Required Monthly Savings – Current Monthly Savings 
o 
Red Flag if: required increase > 50% 
F. Spending Behaviour 
• 
Savings Ratio = Savings / Income 
• 
Red Flag if: 
o 
Savings < 20% for age < 40 
o 
Savings < 30% for age ≥ 40 
• 
OR if expenses consume more than 70% of income 
 
 
3. Output: Financial Health Summary 
 
Parameter 
Value / Diagnosis 
Remark / Actionable 
Liquidity Ratio 
6% → Low Liquidity 
Improve emergency corpus 
Real Estate Allocation 
65% → High 
Diversify portfolio 
Flexibility 
Low 
Switch to more flexible assets 
Retirement Goal Gap 
35% → Unrealistic 
Increase savings or delay retirement 
Education Goal Feasibility Stretch 
Start SIPs in long-term funds 
Savings Gap 
Needs 2× current saving rate 
Review expenses or income sources 
Spending Behaviour 
75% income spent → High Spending Track and reduce lifestyle inflation 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Combine all these parameters and draft a paragraph mentioning key areas for improvement. 
 
 
 
Educational planning 
1. Determine “Years Left” for Each Child’s Education 
UG Default Age = 18 
PG Default Age = 22 
Years Left = UG/PG Year – Child’s Current Age 
 
2. Define Education Type (Domestic vs International) 
➤ Years Left < 5 (Near-Term Goals) 
• 
Check if financial assets ≥ ₹2 Cr 
• 
If yes, suggest foreign education (US/UK) 
• 
If no, suggest domestic UG/PG 
➤ Years Left ≥ 5 (Long-Term Goals) 
• 
Net worth < ₹2 Cr → Default: UG domestic, PG domestic 
• 
Net worth ≥ ₹2 Cr → UG domestic, PG international (US/UK) 
Exception: If there is a substantial retirement goal gap, even PG international is deprioritized. 
 
3. Choose the Cost Base 
🔸 International UG/PG (US/UK) 
• 
Use average of top 10 engineering/MBBS colleges (depending on input) 
o 
UG Engineering (default) 
o 
PG MBA or Masters in Tech 
o 
MBBS only if specifically mentioned 
• 
Use 6–8% annual inflation to project future cost 
• 
Example: 
Future Cost = Current Cost × (1 + Inflation Rate) ^ Years Left 
🔸 Domestic UG/PG 
• 
Use average of top 20 Indian colleges (IITs, NITs, top private) 
• 
Apply education inflation (~9-10%) to get future value 
 
 4. Evaluate Existing Education Savings 
If education savings exist (e.g., SIPs, Sukanya, policies): 
• 
Net Future Value (FV) of these investments 
• 
Subtract from estimated future cost 
• 
Remainder = Additional savings needed 
Prioritization Logic: 
• 
Years Left < 5 → Use current assets first 
• 
Years Left ≥ 5 → Split across: 
o 
Future savings (through SIPs) 
o 
Step-up savings 
o 
Minimal draw from current corpus if flexibility is low 
 
5. Retirement Cross-Check 
If there’s a gap in retirement goal: 
• 
Deprioritize foreign PG 
• 
Focus on UG + Retirement first 
• 
Mark PG as aspirational goal and display gap 
• 
Suggest revisiting after income or savings rise 
 
Step-Up Savings Logic Framework 
Age Group Max Step-Up Rate 
Notes 
30–40 
Up to 15% 
High income growth potential 
40–50 
Up to 10% 
Moderate step-up possible 
>50 
Up to 5% 
Low flexibility due to nearing retirement

**Your Mandated Orchestration Process (You MUST follow this):**
1.  **Framework Assimilation & Initial Strategy (using the provided Client Data and Framework):**
    *   Thoroughly read and internalize the entire "General Logic Framework".
    *   Locate and parse the initial Client Data JSON string that was provided to you from the DataExtractorAgent's output.
    *   Formulate a high-level plan...

2.  **Sequential and Reasoned Delegation (using and augmenting the Client Data):**
    For each relevant section in the "General Logic Framework":
    *   **Assess Applicability:** Based on the current state of the client data (initially the string from the DataExtractor, then subsequently augmented versions) and rules within the framework...
    *   **Select Specialist Agent:** ...
    *   **Craft Precise Delegated Task:** Formulate a task description. This task MUST:
        a.  Provide them with the *most current, fully augmented* client data JSON string.
        # ... rest of the instructions for crafting delegated task ...
    *   **Delegate the Task.**
    *   **Receive and Integrate Output:** The specialist will return the *newly* augmented client data JSON string. This updated JSON string becomes the input for the next delegated task.

# ... (rest of the detailed steps for the manager as in the previous good example) ...
Begin your orchestration by performing step 1. Ensure you have correctly identified and are using the Client Data JSON string provided from the DataExtractorAgent's output. Then, proceed to delegate tasks sequentially according to the "General Logic Framework," starting with aspects of "Client Personal Details" to be handled by the `ClientProfilerAgent`.

Based on this framework, I'll need to carry out a series of orchestrated tasks, delegating them to specialist agents for each section of the framework, starting with "Client Personal Details."
The Client Personal Details section requires us to:
1. Extract and utilize personal information such as client name, date of birth, desired retirement age, spouse name, number of children, and calculate the investment horizon.
2. Assess the client's risk appetite.
I will start by passing the Client Personal Details section to the ClientProfiler specialist for extraction and preliminary analysis.

[95m## Thought:[00m [92mLet's break this down correctly to use the tool for calculating based metrics available only within the constraints established:
Thought: I need to ensure I am using the correct format and approach to these operations, without inventing any new operations. Proceeding with the operations explicitly mentioned within the context of standard procedures.
1. Calculate current and target years for retirement and children's education using standard math before classifying the investment horizon.
- Current Year: 2023
- Rohit's Year of Birth: 1985
- Retirement Age: 55
- First Child's Year of Birth: 2018
Calculations:
- Calculate years to retirement directly: Rohit aims to retire at 55, and he was born in 1985. That means retirement in year 2040 (1985 + 55).
  
- Calculate when the first child (Kahira, born in 2018) will be 18 (undergraduate start target) and 22 (postgraduate start target).
- For Kahira to start UG at 18, the target year is 2036 (2018 + 18).
- For Kahira to start PG at 22, the target year is 2040 (2018 + 22).
Thus we'll proceed to classify the investment horizons.[00m
